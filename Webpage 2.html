Breaststroke is a swimming style in which the swimmer is on their chest and the 
torso does not rotate. It is the most popular recreational style due to the 
swimmer's head being out of the water a large portion of the time, and that it can
be swim comfortably at slow speeds. In most swimming classes, beginners learn 
either the breaststroke or the freestyle <sub>(front crawl)</sub> first. However, at the 
competitive level, swimming breaststroke at speed requires endurance and strength 
comparable to other strokes. Some people refer to breaststroke as the "frog" stroke,
as the arms and legs move somewhat like a frog swimming in the water. The stroke 
itself is the slowest of any competitive strokes and is thought to be the oldest 
of all swimming strokes.
