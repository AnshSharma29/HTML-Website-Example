<p>
Backstroke or back crawl is one of the four swimming styles used in competitive 
events regulated by FINA, and the only one of these styles swum on the back.
This swimming style has the advantage of easy breathing, but the disadvantage of
swimmers not being able to see where they are going. It also has a different start 
from the other three competition swimming styles. The swimming style is similar to 
an upside down front crawl or freestyle. Both backstroke and front crawl are 
long-axis strokes. In individual medley backstroke is the second style swum; 
in the medley relay it is the first style swum.
